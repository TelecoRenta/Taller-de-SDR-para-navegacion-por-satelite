Workshop title: Workshop on Software Defined Receivers for Satellite Navigation
This workshop aims to bring students closer to the practical implementation of GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) receivers based on SDR technology and experience real-time use of such receivers. The activity will allow the students to understand the fundamental concepts of Global Navigation Satellite Systems, such as GPS or Galileo, being introduced to the world of GNU radios and SDR implementations, and experiment with position acquisition in real scenarios. The guided activities also introduce the students to the world of programming tools complementary to SDR, such as docker containers. The workshop is designed to operate with hardware devices and real-time signals or in a post-processing mode from recorded raw GNSS signals.  
The workshop is supported by the PDF guides that consist of two guides: one for the instructor and another guide for the student.
In addition, it provides open-source software implementation of a GNSS receiver and complementary files.
